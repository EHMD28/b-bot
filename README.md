# B-bot Version 1.0.0+ Overview

**I have decided to take a break from this project to focus on learning the skills necessary to write machine learning programs.**

Butler Bot (shortened to B-bot) is a multi-purpose virtual assistant written in Python. 
The purpose of B-bot is to offer a variety of virtual services -- in the form of applets --
that helps the user complete tasks with increased efficiency. 

## Commands
Though applets can be installed to increase B-bot's functionality, he does come with many
built in operations.
